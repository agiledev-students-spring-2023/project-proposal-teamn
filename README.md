# Project Proposal

### Project title

AnyDeal? - Game Price Tracker

### What and Why
Tired of checking different websites looking for a lower price for a game in mind? Can't decide between a pre-owned physical version and a digital version with discount? Confused by different DLC bundles?  

This app compare the prices of a game and give a list of different versions (physical, digital, deluxe, bundle, etc) on different platforms (Switch, Steam, PS4/5, Xbox, etc) with different buying options (Amazon, Gamestop, new/pre-owned,...).

It also gives details of a game including brief descrption, released date, ratings, number of players, languages, genre, developer & publisher, download size, etc.

For people that own multiple consoles, this could tell them the prices for a specific game on different platforms.

For people who are waiting for the lowest price, this will show the All Time Low price as well as a price history chart for both physical and digital versions of the game so you can decide whether and when to wait and save.

### For Whom?

For anyone willing to save some money on game softwares.

### How?

Simply enter the name of the game you are searching for, and games that matches your input will come up. Tap on a game for further details.

Check the CURRENT DEAL page for games that are currently on sale. Games at its all time low price will be indicated by a special label.

Log in to save games to your wish list and get notifications when it's at or below previous lowest price.

Comments on games to help others decide.

### Scope

Not sure if this makes any sense since I have never done or created a similar project before.
