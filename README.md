# Project Proposal

### Project title

Game Time

### What and Why
Tired of checking different websites looking for a lower price for a game in mind? Can't decide between a pre-owned physical version and a  digital version with discount?  

Compare the prices of a game and give a list of different versions (physical, digital, deluxe, bundle, etc) on different platforms (Switch, Steam, PS4/5, Xbox, etc) with different buying options (Amazon, Gamestop, new/pre-owned,...).

Also gives details of a game including regular price, released date, ratings, number of players, languages, developer & publisher, download size, etc.

For people that own multiple consoles, this could tell them the prices for a specific game on different platforms.

For people who are waiting for the lowest price, this will show the All Time Low price as well as a price history chart for both physical and digital versions of the game.

### For Whom?

This

### How?

Simply input the name of the game you are searching for

Check the CURRENT DEAL page for games that are currently on sale. Games at its all time low price will be indicated by a special label.

Log in to save games to your wish list and get notifications when it's at or below previous lowest price.

Comments on games.

### Scope

Not sure if this makes any sense since I have never done or created a similar project before.
